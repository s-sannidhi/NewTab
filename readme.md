# NewTab

## Overview

This project features a static custom new tab page that I created for my personal use. It is designed to offer a clean and minimalistic layout, providing quick access to the websites and resources I use most often.

## Features

- Static, simple design
- Quick links to frequently visited sites
- Supports `/` commands for quick searches

## `/` Commands

The new tab includes special commands to quickly search specific platforms:

- `/y <query>` or `<query> /y` – Searches YouTube
- `/c <query>` or `<query> /c` – Searches ChatGPT

## Installation

Simply add the filepath of the saved index.html page to your default new tab within your browser settings
